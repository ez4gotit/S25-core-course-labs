# Python Web Application

## Overview
This web application is built using Flask and displays the current time in Moscow. The application is designed to be lightweight and efficient, providing real-time updates of the current time.

## Framework Choice
I chose Flask because it is a micro-framework that is easy to set up and use for small web applications. Flask's simplicity allows for rapid development and clear routing, making it an excellent choice for this project.

## Best Practices Applied
1. **Virtual Environments**: I used a virtual environment to manage dependencies, ensuring that the project remains isolated from other Python projects on my system.
2. **Clear Naming Conventions**: Functions and variables are named clearly to enhance readability and maintainability.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: The application logic is kept clean and organized, with routing handled separately from business logic.
4. **Error Handling**: Basic error handling can be implemented to manage unexpected situations gracefully (not shown in the example but recommended for production).
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation is provided in the README.md file, outlining installation steps and usage instructions.

## Testing
I manually tested the application by running it locally and refreshing the page to ensure that the time displayed updates correctly.

## Conclusion
This web application demonstrates how to create a simple yet functional web service using Flask, adhering to best practices in web development.
