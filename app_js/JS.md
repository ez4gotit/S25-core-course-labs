# JavaScript Web Application

## Overview
This web application is built using Node.js with Express.js. It provides a simple greeting message when accessed via a web browser. The application showcases the basic setup of an Express server.

## Framework Choice
I chose Node.js with Express because it is a widely used framework for building web applications in JavaScript. Its non-blocking architecture allows for handling multiple requests efficiently, making it suitable for scalable applications.

## Best Practices Applied
1. **Modular Code**: The application code is kept modular, allowing for easy expansion and maintenance.
2. **Clear Routing**: Routes are defined clearly, making it straightforward to understand how requests are handled.
3. **Error Handling**: Although not fully implemented in the example, proper error handling should be considered for production-level applications.
4. **Documentation**: A README.md file provides installation instructions and usage guidelines, ensuring that users can easily understand how to run the application.

## Testing
I tested the application by running it locally and accessing it through a web browser to verify that the greeting message is displayed correctly.

## Conclusion
This web application serves as a foundational example of how to set up a server using Node.js and Express, following best practices in JavaScript web development.
