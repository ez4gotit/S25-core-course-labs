# Python Unit Tests

## Overview
The application includes unit tests using `unittest` to ensure code quality.

## Best Practices Applied:
- **Test Coverage:** Ensured all functions are tested.
- **Assertions:** Used `assertEqual` and `assertRaises` for thorough testing.
- **Setup Method:** Used `setUp()` for reusability.
- **Edge Cases:** Tested division by zero.
